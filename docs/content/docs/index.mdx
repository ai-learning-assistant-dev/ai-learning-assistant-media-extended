#### Install BRAT

Download [BRAT](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian42-brat) and enable it

#### Add a beta plugin for testing

1. Open [link to BRAT](obsidian://brat?plugin=aidenlx/media-extended), it will open BRAT and ask you to add the plugin. 
   Of course, you can manually add the plugin by using the `Add Beta Plugin` command and enter `aidenlx/media-extended`.
2. Click on `Add Plugin` -- wait a few seconds and BRAT will tell you what is going on

#### Download

Download `media-extended.zip` from GitHub Release: 

#### Enable community plugin

1. Open `Settings` > `Community plugin`
2. Turn on community plugin

#### Open plugin folder

- If you haven't installed any plugin before, you need to open the plugin folder manually: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins`
- If you have installed other plugins, you can use `Open plugin folder` button on the right of the `Installed plugins` section

<Callout>
The `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On macOS, you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder.
</Callout>

#### Create plugin folder

Create a new folder `media-extended` and put files from `media-extended.zip` into the folder

Finally, the folder structure should look like this:

<Files>
  <Folder name="<vault>/.obsidian/plugins" open>
    <Folder name="media-extended" open>
      <File name="main.js" />
      <File name="manifest.json" />
      <File name="styles.css" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Make sure three files are in the plugin folder: `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`

### Reload & Enable

1. Refresh the list of plugins or restart Obsidian if you have installed other plugins
2. Open `Settings` > `Community plugin` and find `Media Extended` in the list
3. Enable the plugin using toggle

## What's next?

If you're coming from earlier versions or planning to join the beta testing, there are some important changes you should be aware of. We recommend starting with the [breaking changes](/v4-breaking-changes) to understand what's different in v4, then check out our [roadmap](/v4-roadmap) to see what's coming next. 

If you're interested in providing feedback during the beta phase, please visit our [beta feedback guide](/beta-feedback).

I understand many of you have been wondering about the long development cycle of v4. I've written a [detailed blog post](/development-journey) explaining the challenges I faced, my personal reflections on the development process, and my vision for the future of Media Extended. If you're curious about what's been happening behind the scenes, I invite you to read it.
