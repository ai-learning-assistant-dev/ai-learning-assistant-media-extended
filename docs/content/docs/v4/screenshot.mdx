Media Extended allows you to capture screenshots from videos and seamlessly embed them into your notes. This isn't just a simple screen grab; it's a powerful way to link visual information directly to your thoughts, complete with timestamps.

## Capturing a Screenshot

You can capture a screenshot in a couple of ways, depending on your workflow.

<Steps>
<Step>
### From the Player

The quickest way to grab a screenshot is from the player's control bar. Just click the camera icon.

This will save the current frame to your vault and insert a link into your active note.

### With Commands

For a more keyboard-driven approach, you can use commands from the command palette:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Save Screenshot` | Saves the current frame to your vault and inserts a link into your note. |
| `Copy Screenshot` | Copies the current frame to your clipboard. |
| `Clip and Save Screenshot` | Lets you crop the frame before saving it and inserting a link. |
| `Clip and Copy Screenshot` | Lets you crop the frame before copying it to the clipboard. |

Assign hotkeys to these commands for even faster access.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Clipping Images

When you use the "Clip" variants of the screenshot commands, a cropping tool will appear over the video. You can adjust the selection to focus on the most important part of the image before saving or copying.

## What Gets Saved

When you save a screenshot, two things happen:

1.  An image file is created in your vault.
2.  A timestamped link to that screenshot is inserted into your active note.

By default, the inserted text looks like this:

```md
- ![[mx-img-nttvxbfgryxc8va2fi327dk8-pt19_80s.jpg|Big Buck Bunny - 00:19|50]] [[big-buck-bunny-1080p-30sec.mp4#t=00:19.80|00:19]]
```

This is a combination of two things:
- `![[screenshot.jpg|TITLE|WIDTH]]`: An embedded image of the screenshot. The text inside `|...|` is the embed's display text, which by default shows the media title and timestamp, and sets the image width.
- `[[video.mp4#t=TIMESTAMP|LABEL]]`: A timestamp link that jumps you to the exact moment in the video.

## Customization

You can fine-tune the screenshot feature in the plugin settings.

### Screenshot Format

You can choose the file format for your saved screenshots. Go to `Settings > Media Extended > Playback > Screenshot`. You can select PNG, JPEG, or WEBP. WEBP offers the best compression but may not be supported on all devices.

### Save Location

By default, screenshots are saved in your vault root. You can specify a custom folder in the settings to keep your attachments organized.

### Link Templates

The text inserted into your note is generated from templates, which you can customize under `Settings > Media Extended > Note > Template`.

- **Screenshot Template**: Defines the structure of the entire line. Default is `\n- !{{SCREENSHOT}} {{TIMESTAMP}}`, which will insert a new line of list item with an screenshot thumbnail and a timestamp link.
  - `{{SCREENSHOT}}`: The placeholder for the image embed.
  - `{{TIMESTAMP}}`: The placeholder for the timestamp link.
- **Screenshot Embed Template**: Defines the display text for the embedded image. Default is `{{TITLE}}{{DURATION}}|50`.
  - `{{TITLE}}`: The title of the media.
  - `{{DURATION}}`: The formatted timestamp.
  - `|50`: An example of setting the image width.

You can change these templates to fit your note-taking style perfectly.
