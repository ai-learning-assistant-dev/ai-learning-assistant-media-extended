Media Extended v4 is a significant update focused on stability, core feature enhancements, and extensibility.

## Key Features

### Redesigned Player
The media player has a new, adaptive design that adjusts to different pane sizes. The controls have been reorganized for a cleaner interface and improved usability.

### Screenshot Clipping
A clipping tool is now available when taking screenshots. This allows capturing a specific region of the video frame instead of the entire view.

### Interactive Transcript View
Subtitle and transcript files (`.srt`, `.vtt`, `.ass`) can be loaded into a new transcript view. The view highlights text as the media plays, and clicking any line seeks the media to that timestamp.
