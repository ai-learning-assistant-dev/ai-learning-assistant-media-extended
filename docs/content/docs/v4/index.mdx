      <File name="main.js" />
      <File name="manifest.json" />

## What's next?

If you're coming from earlier versions or planning to join the beta testing, there are some important changes you should be aware of. We recommend starting with the [breaking changes](/v4-breaking-changes) to understand what's different in v4, then check out our [roadmap](/v4-roadmap) to see what's coming next. 

If you're interested in providing feedback during the beta phase, please visit our [beta feedback guide](/beta-feedback).

I understand many of you have been wondering about the long development cycle of v4. I've written a [detailed blog post](/development-journey) explaining the challenges I faced, my personal reflections on the development process, and my vision for the future of Media Extended. If you're curious about what's been happening behind the scenes, I invite you to read it.
