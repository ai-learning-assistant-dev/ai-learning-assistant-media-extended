Linking to media files in your notes is a powerful way to connect your thoughts to specific moments in audio and video. With Media Extended, you can create links that not only open a media file but also jump to a precise timestamp, loop a segment, or even embed a clip directly into your notes.

This guide will show you how to quickly create media links and then how to customize them for more advanced playback control.

## Get Timestamp from Player

The easiest way to link to a specific moment is to add a timestamp directly from the player.

When you have a media file open, click the **Timestamp ‚≠ê** button in the player controls. A link to that exact moment will be inserted into your active note.

This allows you to take notes and create a "table of contents" for your media without ever having to manually copy-paste timestamps.

For even faster access, use the `Take timestamp` command from the command palette. We recommend assigning a hotkey (e.g., `Cmd+Shift+T`) to this command.

## Understanding Media Links

Clicking the timestamp button creates a link that looks like this:

`[[My Video.mp4#t=1m2s]]`

This is a standard wiki-link to your media file, with a "media fragment" (`#t=...`) added at the end. This fragment tells Media Extended which point in time to jump to.

The time format is flexible. Here are a few examples:

| Link                | Action                                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `[[...#t=1m2s]]`    | Jumps to 1 minute and 2 seconds.         |
| `[[...#t=,50]]`     | Plays from the beginning to 50 seconds.  |
| `[[...#t=10,20]]`   | Plays the segment from 10s to 20s.       |

This works for external media, too: `[External Video](https://example.com/vid.webm#t=10,20)`.

## Embed Media and Create Clips

To embed a media file directly in your notes, just add a `!` before the link.

`![[My Video.mp4#t=1m2s]]`

This will embed the video and start it at the 1 minute, 2 second mark. This works for both local files and videos from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.

### Creating Clips

By providing both a start and end time, you can create a clip that only plays a specific segment of the media.

`![[My Video.mp4#t=1m10s,1m20s]]`

This creates a 10-second clip from "My Video.mp4".

### Resizing Embeds

You can control the width of an embedded video by adding `|` followed by a number.

`![[My Video.mp4|300]]`

## Add Playback Controls

You can add more playback behavior by adding properties to the link, separated by `&`.

For example, to make a clip loop and play automatically, you can write:

`![[My Video.mp4#t=10,20&loop&play]]`

This will embed "My Video.mp4", play the 10-20s segment, loop it, and start it automatically.

## Advanced Reference

For more advanced control, here is a full list of available properties and settings.

### All Link Properties

You can chain these properties together using `&`. For example, `[[My Video.mp4#t=10,20&loop&mute]]` will play the 10-20s segment in a loop without sound.

| Property     | Description                                                  | Example                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `t=`         | Sets the start and end time.                                 | `#t=1m2s,1m5s`                               |
| `loop`       | Loops the media (or the `t=` segment if specified).          | `#t=5,10&loop`                              |
| `mute`       | Starts the media in a muted state.                           | `#mute`                                     |
| `play`       | Starts playing the media automatically.                      | `#play`                                     |
| `vol=`       | Sets the volume from 0 to 100.                               | `#vol=80`                                   |
| `controls`   | Forces the player controls to be visible.                    | `#controls`                                 |
| `noctrl`     | Forces the player controls to be hidden.                     | `#noctrl`                                   |
| `as=`        | Forces the media to be treated as `video` or `audio`.        | `.../media.file#as=video`                   |

### Manual Time Format

If you are writing links by hand, the `t=` property accepts several formats:
- Seconds: `#t=121.5`
- Minutes and seconds: `#t=2m1s`
- Hours, minutes, and seconds: `#t=1h2m3s`

<Callout type="info">
  The format is based on the [W3C Media Fragments URI 1.0 (basic) specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/#naming-time).

### Link and Template Settings

In `Settings > Media Extended`, you can customize:
- **Note Taking > Template**: Change the format of inserted timestamps and screenshots. For example, changing `- {{TIMESTAMP}}` to `- [ ] {{TIMESTAMP}}` will create a checklist item. See [Template Customization](/docs/v4/template) for more.
- **Link behavior**: Define the default click and `Alt/Option`-click actions for media links (e.g., open in a new tab, split pane, or new window). This gives you full control over your workspace layout.
